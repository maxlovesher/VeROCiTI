> **Autonomous Distributed Multi-Agent Traffic Signal Control with Downstream-Aware Coordination, Dynamic Green Wave Emergency Preemption, and Real-Time Incident Resilience.**

---

## 📌 Executive Summary

Urban traffic congestion in smart cities causes billions in lost productivity, fuel wastage, and hazardous delays for emergency services. Traditional traffic signal controllers rely on **fixed-time schedules** or isolated, uncoordinated sensors that merely shift traffic jams from one intersection to the next (*the "downstream spillback" effect*).

This project implements a **Distributed Multi-Agent Traffic Coordination System** built on top of the high-performance **CityFlow** micro-simulation engine. Each traffic junction is powered by an independent `TrafficAgent` that collaborates with adjacent nodes through an inter-agent messaging bus to optimize city-wide throughput, clear bottlenecks, establish emergency green corridors, and mitigate traffic incidents dynamically.

## 🧠 Multi-Agent Mathematical Formulation

Each junction agent executes an **Observe ➔ Communicate ➔ Decide ➔ Act** cycle every decision interval ($T = 3\text{s}$):

### 1. Local Congestion Scoring
For every incoming lane $l \in \{\text{North}, \text{South}, \text{East}, \text{West}\}$:
$$\text{Density}_l = \min\left(1.0, \frac{\text{Vehicle Count}_l}{\text{Lane Capacity}_l}\right)$$
$$\text{Queue Score}_l = \min\left(1.0, \frac{\text{Waiting Vehicles}_l}{\text{Lane Capacity}_l}\right)$$
$$\text{Waiting Score}_l = \min\left(1.0, \frac{\text{Wait Time}_l}{T_{\text{starve}}}\right)$$

The directional congestion score is computed as:
$$\text{Congestion Score}_m = 0.50 \cdot \text{Density}_m + 0.30 \cdot \text{Queue Score}_m + 0.20 \cdot \text{Waiting Score}_m$$

---

### 2. Downstream Capacity-Aware Priority
Rather than greedily clearing the largest local queue, each agent queries the downstream neighbor agent to check if the next intersection can absorb outgoing vehicles:
$$\text{Capacity Factor} = 1.0 - \text{Density}_{\text{downstream}}$$

$$\text{Priority}_m = \text{Congestion Score}_m \times \text{Capacity Factor}$$

> **Core Principle:** If neighbor junction $B$ is congested ($\text{Density} = 85\%$), upstream junction $A$ reduces green time toward $B$, preventing cascading gridlock.

---

### 3. Dynamic Bounded Green Timing
To guarantee traffic stability and eliminate high-frequency signal flickering:
$$\text{Green Duration} = T_{\min} + \text{Priority} \times (T_{\max} - T_{\min})$$
* **$T_{\min}$ (Min Green Time)** $= 12\text{s}$
* **$T_{\max}$ (Max Green Time)** $= 45\text{s}$
* **$T_{\text{yellow}}$ (Yellow Transition)** $= 3\text{s}$

---

### 4. Anti-Starvation Protection
If an unserved direction has been waiting for more than $T_{\text{starve}} = 40\text{s}$, a priority escalation boost is injected:
$$\text{Priority}_{\text{boost}} = \min\left(0.6, \frac{\text{Wait Time} - T_{\text{starve}}}{T_{\text{starve}}} \times 0.5\right)$$

## 🌟 Key Features

1. **5 Interconnected 4-Way Junctions**: Complete arterial grid with dual-lane bidirectional traffic, connecting West (`J1`), North (`J2`), Center (`J3`), East (`J4`), and South (`J5`).
2. **SUMO-Style Visualizer**:
   * Dark asphalt roads with curb markings, dashed lane dividers, and painted directional arrows.
   * Pedestrian zebra crosswalks with red curb caps before stop lines.
   * Dynamic glowing traffic light stop bars (Green / Amber / Red).
   * 2D car models with permanent unique colors, headlights, and rear brake lights.
   * Pan & Zoom viewport controls (`Scroll` to zoom, `Drag` to pan, `C` to center).
3. **🚨 Emergency Ambulance Green Wave Corridor**:
   * Dispatch an ambulance across the West-to-East arterial corridor (`J1 → J3 → J4`).
   * Illuminates the entire road in a **luminous emerald green wave** with streaming forward chevrons (`▲ ▲ ▲`).
   * Agents dynamically preempt signals to maintain continuous green passage.
4. **⚠️ Real-Time Incident Resilience**:
   * Inject accidents/roadblocks on any link.
   * Upstream agents detect the downstream blockage, drop capacity to $5\%$, and divert traffic to alternate avenues.
5. **📊 Central Municipal Dashboard**:
   * Side-by-side telemetry cards for all 5 junctions.
   * Live streaming of inter-agent JSON communication messages.

## 🗺️ Real-World Bhubaneswar Network Simulation (46 Agents)

In addition to the 5-junction CityFlow benchmark engine, the platform includes a **Full-City Bhubaneswar Real-World Simulation Mode** operating over Leaflet dark GIS maps with high-fidelity agent telemetry:

- **46 Autonomous Intersections**: Every major square (Master Canteen, AG Square, Acharya Vihar, Vani Vihar, Rasulgarh, Khandagiri, Delta, Gopabandhu, Siripur, Nayapalli, Ghatikia, Saheed Nagar, VSS Nagar, Sainik School, Palasuni, Chandrasekharpur, Sailashree Vihar, Sundarpada, and more).
- **Topology Rule**: Strictly enforces real-world road degree limits (maximum 4 connected approaches per node, eliminating unreal multi-way clusters).
- **Indian Left-Hand Driving (LHD)**: Carriageway geometry, vehicle lane tracking, and turns adhere strictly to left-hand traffic laws.
- **Microscopic Traffic Signal Physics**:
  - Individual road-facing directional lights mounted on junction approaches.
  - Realistic deceleration on yellow signals and strict compliance stopping prior to pedestrian zebra crossings on red.
  - Emergency vehicle preemption with rolling green-wave corridor activation.
- **Dual Simulation Modes**: Toggle seamlessly between the 5-junction CityFlow backend and the 46-agent Bhubaneswar city map directly from the HUD.
