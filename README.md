# VeROCiTI

**Vehicle Location and City Traffic Intelligence.** An AI traffic-management platform for emergency green corridors, adaptive signal control and vehicle intelligence, built as a Smart India Hackathon prototype for Bhubaneswar.

## What it does

- **Adaptive signal control.** Multi-agent traffic-signal simulation (CityFlow) across 100 junctions, with congestion scoring and manual override.
- **Emergency green corridor.** Routes an ambulance along the fastest path and pre-empts the signals ahead of it.
- **Live GIS map, analytics and incidents.** City-wide congestion, fleet tracking and incident response on one dashboard.
- **Vehicle intelligence (ANPR).** Number-plate recognition and re-identification of vehicles without plates, in three modes:
  - **Live camera:** each second of a webcam feed is split into 24 frames, tracked (YOLOv8 + BoT-SORT), quality-gated (image-quality metrics + Random Forest), read with OCR and voted across frames.
  - **Image analysis:** upload vehicle photos. Each vehicle gets a *plated* card (plate, decoded state/RTO, registration record) or a *no-plate* card (type, colour, make/model, damage, occupants, clothing, cross-camera re-identification). Fields the model is unsure about are left blank rather than guessed.
  - **Video analysis:** upload a clip and get the same cards per vehicle, plus the scene conditions (glare, fog, rain, defocus) that were detected.

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `frontend/` | React 19 + Vite dashboard |
| `city flow model/` | Flask backend: CityFlow signal simulation, tracking API, webcam / image / video pipelines |
| `prototype/` | ANPR and vehicle-intelligence modules (YOLOv8, EasyOCR, quality gate, re-identification) |
| `docs/` | Mobile app designs |

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.10+ and Node.js 18+.

**Windows, one click:** double-click `start.bat`. It installs anything missing on the first run, starts the backend, the dashboard and a local AI engine in the background, and opens http://localhost:5173 once they're ready. Press Q or close its window to stop everything; logs go to `logs/`. Run `.\start.bat -CreateShortcut` once to put a VeROCiTI button on your desktop.

The local AI engine (`colab_verociti_gpu.py`, port 8000) does plate and vehicle detection on your own machine, so image, video and webcam analysis need no Colab. It uses an NVIDIA GPU when PyTorch can see one, and otherwise the CPU and RAM. Options:

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `.\start.bat -InstallGpu` | One-time install of the CUDA build of PyTorch (~3 GB) so detection runs on an NVIDIA GPU |
| `.\start.bat -Cpu` | Run detection on the CPU even when a GPU is available |
| `.\start.bat -NoAI` | Skip the local engine and use a Colab GPU instead |

The same file still runs as a single Colab cell, where it publishes itself through a Cloudflare tunnel as before.

**Any platform, by hand:**

```bash
# 1. Backend (port 5000)
cd "city flow model"
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server_standalone.py

# 2. Frontend (port 5173), in a second terminal
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173.

### Signing in

Sign-in is verified by the backend. Accounts come from the `TEAM_MEMBERS` environment variable (a JSON list with hashed passwords), so no credentials live in the source or the browser bundle. Generate the value with:

```bash
python "city flow model/scripts/make_team_members.py" you@example.com:your-password
```

Without `TEAM_MEMBERS`, only the public demo account `demo@verociti.dev` / `verociti-demo` can sign in. Repeated failed attempts from one client are temporarily locked out.

### One-time model download

YOLOv8 weights download automatically on first use. The vision-language model used for make/model, damage and clothing recognition (about 1.7 GB) is loaded offline, so download it once:

```bash
python -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; snapshot_download('openai/clip-vit-large-patch14', allow_patterns=['*.json','*.txt','model.safetensors'])"
```

Without it the app still works; those attribute fields are simply left blank.

## Configuration

Nothing below is required to run locally. Copy the example files and fill them in as needed:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `frontend/.env.example` | Firebase web config for live cloud sync (`VITE_FIREBASE_*`) |
| `prototype/firebase_config.example.json` | Backend Firebase sync (copy to `firebase_config.json`) |
| `.env.example` | Team accounts (`TEAM_MEMBERS`), Cloudinary storage, remote AI service URL, CLIP model id |

Secrets and local configuration are git-ignored.

## Notes

- **Registration records are simulated.** No live Vahan/Parivahan API is connected. Only the state and RTO office decoded from the plate are real; owner details are generated from the plate text and are labelled as simulated in the UI.
- A plate is only reported when the read reaches 60% confidence and forms a valid Indian registration with a real state code. Anything weaker is shown as unreadable.

## Deployment

- **Docker / Render:** the multi-stage `Dockerfile` builds the frontend and serves it with the Flask backend through Gunicorn; `render.yaml` is a Render blueprint.
- **Firebase Hosting:** `deploy-firebase.bat` builds and deploys the frontend (run `firebase use --add` once to select your project).

## Licence

MIT. See `frontend/LICENSE`.
